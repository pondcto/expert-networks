 * All components accept their data via props, so you can:
 * 1. Fetch data at the parent level (DeepResearchWorkspace)
 * 2. Pass down as props to each panel component
 * 3. Use React Query, SWR, or similar for data fetching
 *
 * Example:
 * ```tsx
 * const { data: chatHistory } = useQuery('chatHistory', fetchChatHistory);
 * return <ChatHistoryPanel chats={chatHistory} />;
 * ```
